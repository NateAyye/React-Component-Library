## Props / Attributes

------ 
 - `color` = any built in html color will work and will change the background color of the main element * also will automatically change the foreground color to the respective contrasted color.
        (i.e. color={'white'} means the foreground will be black to allow for easy reading)
 - `glow` = Turns the button into a neon sign version of the button with hover effects.

 - `activated` = turns the button into one that keeps a bottom border when clicked on, but it doesn't keep it when clicked off if you want it to keep the border persistent then the href value of the button will tell it to keep the border when it's on that route.
